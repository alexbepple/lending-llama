# Set up

## Requirements
* see `.tool-versions`
* â€“ or use [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/) directly ðŸ˜‰

Choices:
* npm over yarn 
  * npm is on-board after installing Node.js
* Java _11_
  * Even though slightly outdated, itâ€™s default for client. Therefore, less risk of incompatibilities.
  * Client seems to be using SDKMAN + Zulu. 
SDKMAN is not an option; it provides no Node. 
SDKMAN seems to have Zulu 11.0.12 & .13. 
The closest asdf version to this is zulu-11.2.3.
